# GANs inversion for seismic data

This document is a brief intoduction.
My work is composed of three parts:first part is GAN, second part is inversion and third part is statistics.

The code has been uploaded, and details will come soon.


#PART1 GANs
The code of generative adversarial networks(GANs) is created by Eric laloy, and the author rewrite some details to apply for model generations.




#PART2 inversion code

The code is copy the framework of Eric's ZS method. And the author apply it to seismic inversion and add module seismic inversion.
The seismic data is provided by Lixin Wang, and inversion code is writed by Fortran.



#PART3 statistical tools
The code of tools include variogram/probability function/connection function.
All spatial function maps are generated by this code.



If anyone need training results or seismic data, can contact me by e-mail 284023229@qq.com
