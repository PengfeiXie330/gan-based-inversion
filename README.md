# GANs inversion for seismic data

This document is a brief intoduction.
My work is composed of three parts:first part is GAN, second part is inversion and third part is statistics.

The code has been uploaded, and details will come soon.


#PART1 GANs
The code of generative adversarial networks(GANs) is created by Eric laloy, and the author rewrite some details to apply for model generations.




#PART2 inversion code

The code is based on Matlab. And the author is traslating it to python file.
The seismic data is provided by Lixin Wang.



#PART3 statistical tools
The code of tools include variogram/probability function/connection function.
All spatial function maps are generated by this code.



If anyone need training results or seismic data, can contact me by e-mail 284023229@qq.com
